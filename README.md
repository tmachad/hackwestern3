This is a small agar.io clone that my group and I made during Hack Western 3 called Hangry Time!

We began with almost no knowledge of javascript, nodejs, or any of the other tools we used to create Hangry Time, but we managed to pull it all together over the two days of Hack Western. The game is limited, you can only move around and see other players, but feel free to give it a whirl!
